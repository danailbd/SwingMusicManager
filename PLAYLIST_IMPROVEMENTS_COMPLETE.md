#### **Merged Playlist Logic**
```tsx
const allPlaylists = React.useMemo(() => {
  const custom = customPlaylists || [];
  const spotify = spotifyPlaylists?.items || [];
  
  // Convert Spotify playlists to consistent format
  const formattedSpotifyPlaylists = spotify.map((playlist: any) => ({
    id: `spotify-${playlist.id}`,
    spotifyId: playlist.id,
    name: playlist.name,
    // ... additional metadata
    isSpotifyPlaylist: true,
    trackCount: playlist.tracks?.total || 0,
    isOwned: playlist.owner?.id === user?.id,
  }));

  // Combine and sort: imported first, then by recently used
  return combined.sort((a, b) => {
    if (!a.isSpotifyPlaylist && b.isSpotifyPlaylist) return -1;
    if (a.isSpotifyPlaylist && !b.isSpotifyPlaylist) return 1;
    // Then by last used/updated date
  });
}, [customPlaylists, spotifyPlaylists, userId]);
```

#### **Drag-and-Drop Implementation**
```tsx
<DndContext
  sensors={sensors}
  collisionDetection={closestCenter}
  onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
>
  <SortableContext
    items={songs.map(song => song.id)}
    strategy={verticalListSortingStrategy}
  >
    <div className="space-y-3">
      {songs.map((song, index) => (
        <SortableItem
          key={song.id}
          song={song}
          index={index}
          // ... other props
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  </SortableContext>
</DndContext>
```

#### **Tagging Integration**
```tsx
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    setSelectedTrackForTagging(song);
    setShowTagSelector(true);
  }}
  className="p-2 text-gray-400 hover:text-purple-400 hover:bg-purple-500/10 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200"
  title="Add tags"
>
  <TagIcon className="w-4 h-4" />

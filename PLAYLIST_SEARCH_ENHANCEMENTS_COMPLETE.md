## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [playlistSearchQuery, setPlaylistSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [searchFilter, setSearchFilter] = useState<'all' | 'custom' | 'spotify'>('all');
```

### Filtering Logic
```typescript
const filteredPlaylists = React.useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = allPlaylists;
  
  // Apply type filter first
  if (searchFilter === 'custom') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(playlist => !playlist.isSpotifyPlaylist);
  } else if (searchFilter === 'spotify') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(playlist => playlist.isSpotifyPlaylist);
  }
  
  // Apply search query
  if (!playlistSearchQuery.trim()) {
    return filtered;
  }

  const query = playlistSearchQuery.toLowerCase();
  return filtered.filter(playlist => 
    playlist.name.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    playlist.description?.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    playlist.owner?.toLowerCase().includes(query)
  );
}, [allPlaylists, playlistSearchQuery, searchFilter]);
```

### Search Highlighting
```typescript
const highlightSearchText = (text: string, query: string) => {
  if (!query.trim()) return text;
  
  const regex = new RegExp(`(${query.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&')})`, 'gi');
  const parts = text.split(regex);
  
  return parts.map((part, index) => 
    regex.test(part) ? (
      <span key={index} className="bg-yellow-500/30 text-yellow-200 rounded px-1">
        {part}
      </span>
    ) : part
  );
};
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **useMemo** for filtering logic to prevent unnecessary recalculations
2. **Debounced search** - instant feedback without lag
3. **Efficient regex** escaping for search highlighting
4. **Minimal re-renders** with proper state management

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **Search input**: Purple focus ring (`focus:ring-purple-500`)
- **Custom playlists**: Purple indicators and buttons
- **Spotify playlists**: Green indicators and buttons
- **Highlighting**: Yellow background with yellow text (`bg-yellow-500/30 text-yellow-200`)

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-friendly** search input
- **Flexible filter buttons** that adapt to content
- **Proper spacing** and padding for touch targets

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

1. **Touch-friendly** clear button (adequate size)
2. **Responsive** filter buttons that stack on smaller screens
3. **Accessible** keyboard handling
4. **Clear visual feedback** for all interactions

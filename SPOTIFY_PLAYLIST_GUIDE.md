```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  userId: string;
  songs: TaggedSong[];
  spotifyId?: string;        // Spotify playlist ID
  isSpotifyPlaylist?: boolean; // True if imported/synced
  lastSyncedAt?: Date;       // Last sync timestamp
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**"Not authenticated"**
- Solution: Make sure you're logged in to Spotify
- Check: Authentication status in the app

**"Playlist already imported"**
- Solution: The playlist is already in your library
- Check: Look for it in "Your Tagged Playlists"

**"Failed to sync playlist to Spotify"**
- Possible causes: Network issues, Spotify API limits, invalid tokens
- Solution: Try again in a few minutes, or re-authenticate

**"Failed to add tracks to playlist"**
- Possible causes: Some tracks may not be available in your region
- Solution: Sync will skip unavailable tracks and continue

### Rate Limiting
- Spotify API has rate limits
- Large playlists may take longer to import/sync
- The app includes retry logic for failed requests

## Testing

Use the test page at `/test-spotify-integration` to verify:
1. Authentication status
2. Spotify playlist loading
3. Import functionality
4. Sync functionality
5. Error handling

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Regular Syncing**: Sync playlists after making changes
2. **Batch Operations**: Make multiple changes before syncing
3. **Network**: Ensure stable internet for large playlists
4. **Backup**: Your local playlists are preserved even if Spotify sync fails

### For Developers
1. **Error Handling**: All API calls include try-catch blocks
2. **User Feedback**: Clear notifications for all operations
3. **Idempotency**: Import operations are safe to retry
4. **Data Consistency**: Local data is source of truth for syncing

## Troubleshooting

### Playlist Not Appearing After Import
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh the playlist library
3. Verify authentication status
4. Check if playlist was actually created in Firestore

### Sync Not Working
1. Check if playlist has `spotifyId` set
2. Verify Spotify authentication is valid
3. Check for API rate limiting errors
4. Ensure songs have valid Spotify URIs

### Missing Songs After Sync
1. Some tracks may not be available in your region
2. Check Spotify for regional restrictions
3. Songs without Spotify URIs are skipped
4. Check console logs for specific track errors

## Future Enhancements
